# Theres Options

A web-service dedicated to helping new investors take a peek into current trends in certain categories of the market alongside the big players buying those trends up.

Still need to implement changing the categories and the individual stock-look-up as this was so far a test to see the functionality, but this will come in time!

Also a side note, if you use this project, just be warned that the polygon API requires an API key and it only allows 5 requests/min at the free tier. This is why the data is updated via manual buttons and not automatically.
